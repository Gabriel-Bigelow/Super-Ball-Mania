Super Ball Mania is an action-packed minigame-based party game. Compete against your friends to earn the most points by the end of the game, and become a Super Ball Maniac.

## Purpose 

This game was created as a personal exercise in JavaScript and bundling, packaging, and distribution. I also wanted to make something that served a secondary purpose, which was making a fun game that my friends and I could enjoy, as well as random users on the internet.

## Features

* 10 unique minigames
* Character customization
* Customizable bindings
* Up to 8-player local multiplayer (with the help of a third-party controller grouping program)
* Online multiplayer through Steam Remote Play Together
