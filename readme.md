Super Ball Mania is an action-packed minigame-based party game. Compete against your friends to earn the most points by the end of the game, and become a Super Ball Maniac.

Games are 10 rounds long with 4 players, by default. To add or remove players, visit the character customization screen.

Click "Play Now" on the game select screen to automatically add all games to the game selection, and jump right into the action! Players will play "Ballf With Your Friends, Color Clash, Cumulonimble, Flappy Balls, Hot Potato, Light On Your Feet, Most Wanted, Row Race, Simon Says, and Sumo." Controllers are automatically assigned to the first (x number of) players in the game, depending on (x number of) controllers being plugged in to the computer. If there are any players without controllers to be assigned to them, they will be automatically assigned keyboard controls. Keyboard controls can be found on the main menu. Controls can also be reassigned on the Character Customization screen.
